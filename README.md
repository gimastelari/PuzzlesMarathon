# Puzzles Marathon (Static Site)

A simple, accessible static site for a proposed community marathon to support the autism community.

## Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub repo (e.g., `puzzlesmarathon`).
2. Upload all files in this folder (including `index.html`, `assets/`).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`. Save.
5. Your site will appear at `https://<username>.github.io/puzzlesmarathon/`

### Custom Domain (Optional: puzzlesmarathon.com)
- In repo **Settings → Pages**, add your domain.
- In your DNS, create a CNAME record pointing `puzzlesmarathon.com` to `<username>.github.io`.
- Add `A` records for GitHub Pages IPs if using an apex domain (see GitHub docs).

## Edit Content
Open `index.html` and replace placeholder text (date, location, contacts). Replace placeholder images in `assets/img/`.
